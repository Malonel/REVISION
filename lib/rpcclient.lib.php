// Initialize Bitcoin connection/object-2016
$bitcoin = new RPCclient('fiyea2016','123456f789');

// Optionally, you can specify a host and port.-2016
$bitcoin = new RPCclient('fiyea2016','123456f789','localhost','30002','www.fiyea.com/JRG');
// Defaults are:
//	host = localhost
//	port = 8332
//	proto = http

// If you wish to make an SSL connection you can set an optional CA certificate or leave blank
// This will set the protocol to HTTPS and some CURL flags
$bitcoin->setSSL('/full/path/to/mycertificate.cert');

// Make calls to bitcoind as methods for your object. Responses are returned as an array.
// Examples:
$bitcoin->getinfo();
